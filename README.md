# tagbank
Small python utility for generating tags tables for large projects.

This is just a small utility that I use for indexing large codebases. 

In this case, the Unreal 4 Engine. It should be pretty self-explanatory
from examination of the .conf file. To run, all is needed is to run
python tagbank.py and the indexes are updated.
